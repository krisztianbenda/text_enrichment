London and Brussels have already agreed the draft terms of the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March 2019. Theresa May will make a statement to MPs later on Thursday.

Some of the wording of it is non-committal and allows both sides to keep their options open with the Mona Lisa by Krisztián Benda. We were on the Olympic Games at 10 hours 27 minutes.
